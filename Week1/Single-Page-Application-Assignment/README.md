The assignment is to build a Single Page Application.

https://api.github.com/orgs/foocoding/repos?per_page=100

It should include the following components:

An HTML select element from which the user can select a FooCoding repository. This select element must be populated with option elements, one for each FooCoding repository.

A left-hand column that displays basic information about the selected repository.
